        <p>My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br>
		found out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to happen<br>
		soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br>
		Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I kind<br>
		of took him for granted or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents are<br>
		just always there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging you<br>
		to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br>
		try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br>
		day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br>
		"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br>
		crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's different since<br>
		Dad got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in the<br>
		near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-2">
        <p>Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that<br>
		question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br>
		sible. One day he won't be here to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I feel lucky when I hear<br>
		his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br>
		ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.</p>

        My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br>
		I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the most random stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like<br>
		how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br>
		And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br>
		takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br>
		into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br>
		will go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br>
		doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br>
		I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook<br>
		because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br>
		cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br>
		goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br>
		He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.</p>

        The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br>
		hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br>
		(Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br>
		shoes he always wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br>
		Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br>
		The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br>
		and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br>
		how he is at home and at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out what a good qual-<br>
		ity	that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br>
		made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted to be or not.<br>
		Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br>
		my dad being a teacher there I was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two things now.<br>
		First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br>
		And two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br>
		cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br>
		lot of other dads I've met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because they're into<br>
		sports or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br>
		wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br>
		makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br>
		about what the kids at school say anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is he's a good<br>
		teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br>
		cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br>
		best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br>
		for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and my family.</p>

    <!-- My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. 
    If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth 
    empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking
    proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections 
    in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank
    was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and
    took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, 
    and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into 
    financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my 
    head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man,
    and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. 
    From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, 
    and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, 
    but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, 
    Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb 
    that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted 
    to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to 
    keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. 
    My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken
    our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to
    quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will
    kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is. -->
